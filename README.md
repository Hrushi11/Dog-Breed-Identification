# Multi Class Dog Breed Classification
This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using Tensorflow 2.0 and Tensorflow Hub.

## 1. Problem
Identifying the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

## 2. Data
The data in this project is from Kaggle: <br>

## 3. Evaluation
The evaluation is a file with prediction probabilities for each dog breed of each test image. <br>

## 4. Features
Information about the data:

Dealing with images (Unstructured Data) - Deep Learning / Transfer Learning.
* 120 breeds of dogs -> means there are 120 differnt classes.
* There are around 10,000+ images in the training set (Images have labels).
* There are around 10,000+ images in the test set (Images have no labels, we have to predict them).
